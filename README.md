# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

This project was created for Bootcamp students by a Bootcamp student as a place to store, organize and refer to Prework Notes. 
It solves the problem of students not always having a reliable, easy to navigate storage place for their notes.
I learned how a html, CSS and Javascript document is formatted, as well as various functionalities and connection methods to create a cohesive webpage.
In another vein, I learned how to complete the Git Workflow multiple times vis-a-vis creating and compiling branches, creating pull requests and keeping the main branch up to date.
